## Dart

## AutoML

## Shapash
This beautiful library is developed by a group of MAIF Data Scientists. This library aims to make machine learning Interpretable in other words this is used to explaining the code. This library is very easy to use and has so many amazing features. If we want to do any visualization on the dataset then shapash will use because it displays the revealed labels that everyone can understand or we can say that it displays clear and understandable results, It makes DataScientiests understand the model easily which will good for them. 

## Dtale

## Pipe
it is python library and it helps in keep code clean and more readable. 

## EvalML
EvalML is AutoML libaray which builds, Optimize, and evalutes machine learning pipelines using domain specific objective functions.
keyfunctionality
 * Automation
 * Data checks
 * End to end
 * Model understanding
 * Domain-specfic

## Feather
Feather is more faster than csv. it has better read, write capabilities. and also it take less file size(memory size) as compered to csv and it will effect in case of cloud. Among the read write and file storage, if any one is more then billeing would be more.
